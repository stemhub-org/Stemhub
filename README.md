# StemHub

> **Git meets music production** — Version control and collaboration platform for music producers.

StemHub brings Git/GitHub workflows to music production, enabling producers to version their projects, collaborate seamlessly across DAWs, and showcase their work through a unified platform.

*"Git revolutionized code. Figma transformed design. StemHub is here to revolutionize music production."*

## What is StemHub?

StemHub solves the version control problem that has plagued music production for decades. No more `project_final_v2_FINAL_real_THISONE.wav` — just clean commits, branches, and merge workflows that developers have enjoyed for 20 years.

**Dual-component system:**
- **StemHub Plugin (DAW)** — Commit, push, pull, and branch directly from your DAW
- **StemHub Platform (Web)** — Cloud storage, collaboration tools, portfolio showcase, and cross-DAW exports
